'''
all communication is handled in this method. It connects Ã­ts sockets to the port waiting for ProCAKE to send an initializing message
once this is received it reads into the case base until a finished string is send by procake
afterwards it will always wait for the next query that it runs through the snn to send back the similarities
terminates if the terminate string is sent
